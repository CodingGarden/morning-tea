People always talk about contributing to open source. However, it seems so intimidating. All i think of is what if i contribute buggy code that doesn't work. Do you need to be at a certain level?

hey CJ, been meaning to ask, do you have any preferred CSS-in-JS libraries? its a very opinionated topic but I've really found working with emotion to be nice. It's very performant, supports bable macros, and is similar to the styled components API. (sorry for long message)
